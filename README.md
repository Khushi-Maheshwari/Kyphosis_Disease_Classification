# Kyphosis_Disease_Classification
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to classify kyphosis disease using patient data. Kyphosis is a spinal disorder where an excessive outward curve of the spine results in an abnormal rounding of the upper back. The goal of this project is to accurately predict the presence of this condition using machine learning techniques.

# Project Overview
# Key Features:
Data Pre-processing 
Modeling:
  - Logistic Regression:
      Implemented as the primary model to classify kyphosis disease.
      The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
  - Evaluation:
      The model was evaluated using accuracy scores and a confusion matrix to understand its performance.

# Files in the Repository:
- `Kyphosis_Disease_Classification.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, model implementation, and evaluation.
- `kyphosis.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model (ensure it is present in the same directory as the notebook).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
